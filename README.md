# Earthquake Damage Grade Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the **damage grade** of buildings affected by an earthquake using machine learning techniques. The model classifies buildings into different damage levels based on structural and geological features.


## Dataset
The dataset consists of various structural and locational attributes of buildings, including:
- Foundation type
- Roof and ground floor type
- Number of floors
- Age of the building
- Soil type
- Geographic location
- Other engineering parameters

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python (>=3.7)


### Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Model
This project utilizes:
- Feature engineering techniques such as one-hot encoding and scaling.
- Machine learning models like **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **Neural Networks**.
- Hyperparameter tuning for better performance.

## Results
The model achieves an **71 %** and an **F1-score of 71 % ** on the test dataset.

## Features
- **Multi-class classification** of damage grades.
- **Handles missing data** and categorical features efficiently.
